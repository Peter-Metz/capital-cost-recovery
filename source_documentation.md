## Country-specific details

* **AUS - Australia:** Depreciation of most capital allowances, such as **machinery**, is based on the effective life of a unit or plant. However, the taxpayers may reasonably self-determine the effective life of a unit or plant or may choose the effective life contained in a published determination of the Commissioner of Taxation, see Australian Taxation Office, "Taxation Ruling," https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=TXR%2FTR20195%2FNAT%2FATO%2F00001. Taxpayers may choose the straight-line method or the double diminishing value method (200% of the
straight-line rate) for calculating the tax-deductible depreciation for all depreciating assets except intangible assets (there is also a pre-termined rate for buildings), see EY, "Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide," https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-worldwide-corporate-tax-guide-2019/$FILE/ey-worldwide-corporate-tax-guide-2019.pdf. For the dataset, we assume a 7-year double diminishing value method for machinery.
