# Capital Cost Recovery across the OECD

The Tax Foundationâ€™s publication [Capital Cost Recovery across the OECD](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/capital-cost-recovery-across-the-oecd/) shows how capital allowances compare across OECD countries and how they have developed since 2000. The dataset we compiled for the years 1980 to 2019 is made available as a resource for research.



## The Dataset

### Scope
The dataset compiled for this publication includes the 2019 depreciation schedules of all 36 OECD countries for the following three assets: industrial buildings, machinery, and intangibles. It also includes the best available inventory valuation methods in OECD countries.

In addition, the dataset includes historic depreciation schedules for the time period 1980 to 2018. However, years prior to 2000 do not include data for all OECD countries. The dataset also includes some historic depreciation schedule data for non-OECD countries for the years 1979 to 2017.

To be able to calculate average capital allowances weighted by GDP, the dataset includes GDP data for OECD countries.


### Depreciation Methods

There are various depreciation methods. The dataset captures them as follows:

- **SL - Straight-Line Method**: An asset is depreciated by an equal allowance (in nomianl terms) each year. E.g., an annual allowance of 10% over 10 years.

* **DB - Declining-Balance Method**: An asset is depreciated based on its _remaining_ book value. E.g., in the case of a $100 investment, in the first year the allowance is 25% of $100, in the second year it's 25% of ($100-$25), and so forth.

* **DB or SL - Declining-Balance Method with a Switch to the Straight-Line Method**: An asset gets depreciated with the declining-balance method for a (number of) year(s) and then the depreciation method switches to straight-line. In some countries businesses switch from DB to SL when depreciating an asset as soon as the allowance is higher under SL than under DB.

* **SL2 - Straight-Line Method with Changing Rates**: An asset is depreciated under the straight-line method. However, after a (number of) year(s) the depreciation rate changes. E.g., an asset is depreciated at 20% for 3 years and then at 10% for four years. Countries that switch their depreciation rates twice are treated as if they switched them only once (see Italy).

* **initialDB - Declining-Balance Method with an Initial Allowance**: As asset is depreciated under the declining-balance method but there is an additional allowance in the first year.


As we assume that businesses will choose the tax-optimizing depreciation method and thus list that method in the dataset while ignoring less optimal alternatives businesses might have in a country.

The document *Oxford_CBT_Tax_Database_Data_Description.md* provides more details on how this dataset is structured and what the variables are.



## Explanation of Files in Repository

### /main directory

Location of the R code, the source documentation, a detailed description of the dataset, and this README.

The R code reads in and downloads the necessary data, cleans the data, corrects data manually, merges datasets, and produces intermediate and final output datasets and tables.

The source documentation cites all the sources used.

The description of the dataset explains the variables it contains and gives some background information.


### /source-data

Location of **input** files to .R code file including:

- `cost_recovery_data.csv` Dataset that includes variables that reflect the depreciation schedules of all OECD-countries and some non-OECD countries for the years 2000-2019 (and for some countries for the years 1980-1999 as well).

- `country_codes.csv` Dataset that includes all 249 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Includes official country names in various languages, ISO country codes, continents, and further geographical information.

- `gdp_historical.xlsx` U.S. Department of Agriculture's dataset of historical real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and growth rates of GDP for 176 countries and various regions (in billions of 2010 dollars) for the years 1980 to 2018.

- `gdp_projected.xlsx` U.S. Department of Agriculture's dataset of projected real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and growth rates of GDP for 176 countries and various regions (in billions of 2010 dollars) for the years 2011 to 2031.


### /final-data
Location of **final data** files of .R code file including

- `npv_all_years.csv` Dataset that includes the net present value calculations of capital allowances for each of the three asset types by country (all OECD and EU countries) and by year (for all years for which we have data). It also includes the average of the three asset types (weighted by an asset's estimated share in the economy), the average weighted by GDP and GDP data.


### /final-outputs
Location of **output tables** that are included in the publication or needed to produce the charts that are in the publication.

- `asset_averages.csv` Table showing the average net present value of capital allowances in the OECD by asset type for the year 2019.

- `cit_rates_timeseries.csv` Table showing the average and weighted average (weighted by GDP) combined corporate income tax rate in the OECD for each year from 2000 to 2019.

- `eu_cctb.csv` Table showing the weighted net present value of capital allowances in EU countries for the year 2019. Also includes the net present value of capital allowances under the EU's Common Corporate Tax Base (CCTB) proposal.

- `npv_europe.csv` Table showing the weighted net present value of capital allowances in European countries for the year 2019. Also includes a column that ranks the countries by the net present value of their capital allowances.

- `npv_ranks_2019.csv` Table showing the net present value of capital allowances by OECD country and asset type for the year 2019. It also includes the average of the net present values of capital allowances weighted by each asset's estimated share in the economy and a ranking for each asset type and the average.

- `npv_weighted_timeseries.csv` Table showing the average and weighted average (weighted by GDP) net present value of capital allowances in the OECD for each year from 2000 to 2019.
